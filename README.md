# NoShorts

This Firefox extension is designed to remove shorts from the "Subscriptions" tab and the "Home Page" tab.

This is a cobbled together extension on some spare time that I'm making available. There are probably many points that can be improved especially in terms of performance, design or even functionality. 

I'm looking forward to feedback or even ideas if you have any. If you want to participate to the development of the project, it is open-source and the code is available on Github.
